# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros", the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility. Here's how it works:

    Choose a task you want to work on.
    Set the pomodoro (timer) to 25 minutes.
    Work on the task until the timer goes off.
    Take a short break (5 minutes).
    Every four pomodoros, take a longer break (30 minutes).

The idea is to reduce the impact of interruptions on focus and flow, improving productivity. The break intervals serve to relax and recharge the mind to maintain high performance throughout the day. It also encourages individuals to break their work down into manageable tasks or stages, which can aid project planning and time management.
